The five courses under the MIT Supply Chain MicroMasters include:

SC1x: Supply Chain Fundamentals

This course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. Students will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The main topic areas we will focus on this course are: Demand Forecasting, Planning, and Management, Inventory Planning, Management, and Control, Transportation Planning, Management, and Execution.

SC2x: Supply Chain Design

Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales & Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.

SC3x: Supply Chain Dynamics

The course is divided into 3 sections. First, we introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. Second, we explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain. Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for real situations.

SC4x: Supply Chain Technology and Systems

We start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required. We then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed. Finally, we dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.

CFx: Comprehensive Final Exam

This is a final proctored exam that covers concepts across 5 courses explained above. To take the CFx, a student must have passed all five SCx courses as a verified learner. This exam is offered twice a year. Upon completion, the student gains a MicroMasters in SCM credential from MITx.
